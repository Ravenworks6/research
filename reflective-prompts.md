## Did you remember to take regular breaks away from your screen during this week? How often? Did you stretch your body?
Yes I do take regular breaks but not breaks where you would relax but breaks to sort kids, make meals, do the housework, answer calls, txt's and work.

## What is Timeboxing? Have you heard of it before? Will you use it?
Timeboxing is a term from Agile software development in which a task is completed within a predefined time. The deadline is non-negotiable.  It is designed to eliminate procrastination and perfectionism which can lead to late delivery. As a result this improves productivity.

Steps to practice timeboxing
1. Decide on the task to be completed.
2. Remove potential sources of interruption.
3. Set a timer for the period predetermined by you.
4. Focus on the task til the timer goes off.
5. Stop when the timer goes off.
6. Take a break and reward yourself for finishing the timebox.
7. Repeat as necessary.

I do not use timeboxing for productivity due to perfectionism but use a bullet journal.

## On a 0-5 scale, how confident are you with each of the assignments?
3ish

## What are of you proud of up to this point in the course?
That Im actually understanding most of the work.

## Do you have a personal learning strategy? If so, what parts of your learning strategy worked? What problems did you face? If you don't have a personal strategy yet, what do you think might work? Invent and describe a strategy for yourself. 
I do not have a personal learning strategy.

## If you could send a time traveling text message back to yourself at the start of this course, what would it say?
Get clear directions around navigating the Student Hub.

## What is Python?
Python is an open source high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language that can be used for a wide variety of applications. Some typical uses is for AI & machine learning, data analytics, web development, search engine optimisation (SEO), blockchain, game development, automation.

## Have you developed a habit of exploring?
Yes my nature is to be very curious of the world around me.  Whether is be how something works or where someone comes from. I often like to dig further then is what on the surface of something - sometimes to my detriment. Once I had a hair in a second-hand camera lens I brought for my camera and decided to take it apart too see if I could remove it and the lens literally blew up in my face and I couldnt put it back together again.  So a habit of exploring is good but know when to stop before it becomes a bad thing.

## Have you meditated before?
Yes.  So I dont turn into a crazy person. Meditations I do are more Mindful Meditations. When I feel overwhelmed it is good to take a break and concentrate on breathing in the moment.

## Is there something over which you have gained a degree of mastery before in your life? Gymnastics, Rubik's Cubes, A Video Game? What did it take?
Cant say that I have. Whats the saying? "Jack of All Trades, Master of None"

## Do you consider yourself a developer yet?
Maybe a 50% developer. To me a developer is creating on the computer.  Being a graphic designer Im halfway there but am lacking in the other side of developing....the coding.

## Do you value creativity? As a value itself? What about as a tool for learning to think logically?
Yes.  I know many artists and have been immersed in art most of my life.  Being surounded by creative people even if some things they create dont make logical sense it is still holds valuable lessons. Im still trying to figure out the connection between creativity and logical thinking.  Romans lessons are bridging that gap.

## How many tabs do you have open in your web browser right now? What is the ratio of study related tabs to distraction related tabs?
5 Tabs in the browser on the computer and it is all study related.  65 tabs open on my mobile phone and they are all distractions but informative ones.

## Have you had a fight response to technology? What does it feel like? How did you overcome this?
No I do not yet have a fight response but Im guessing the older I get the more fighty I get with tech that I dont understand.

## What is an IDE?
IDE - Integrated Development Environment which is software for building applications that combines developer tools into a single Graphical User Interface (GUI). An IDE consists of source code editor, local build automation and debugger.  It helps developers to start programming new applications quickly saving time through not having to configure and intergrate multiple utilities because it is all on the same workbench. Most IDE's save time with intelligent code completion and automated code generation which removes the need to type out full character sequences. IDE's parse code as it is written so bugs are identified in real-time. Developers can execute actions without switching applications and has syntax highlighting in to distinguish grammar in the text editor.

## What did you learn out of the Marshmallow Challenge?
 Things I became aware of was Keep It Simple, Be Aware of Time to Completion, Build from the Top Down and Choose your Team carefully :joy:

## Did you have any blocks during this challenge? How did you overcome them?
One block way syncing with the group but once we all got to know each other a bit better and on the same wavelength we overcame it.

## So far, what was the hardest moment of this course for you?
Figuring out the dashboard and where we are supposed to be in the reading module as oppossed to the lectures.

## What is OOP?
Object-oriented Programming is a programming model that organizes software design around data or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behaviour. OOP focuses on objects that developers want to manipulate instead of the logic required to manipulate them. It is suited for programs that are large, complex and actively updated or maintained. This includes programs for manufacturing and design as well as mobile applications. There are 4 main principles of OOP encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance and polymorphism.

## Are you using the canvas content? Do you find it helpful or tedious?
Yes I do find it really helpful but am really behind in the reading.  After a long period I sometimes turn on speech and highlight the paragraphs i want the computer to dictate but I need to find a better voice to listen to as the default one is very annoying.

## Which parts of the work did you find tedious?
There is alot of reading so that gets a bit tedious.  It would be good to break it up with slides to read and maybe have a quiz at the end so you know if you understand it properly.

## What is polymorphism?
Objects are designed to share behaviors and they can take on more than one form. The program determines which meaning or usage is necessary for each execution of that object from a parent class, reducing the need to duplicate code. A child class is then created, which extends the functionality of the parent class. Polymorphism allows different types of objects to pass through the same interface.
